API Performance Testing with JMeter
===================================

This directory contains the results of API performance testing using JMeter for a todo REST API generated by a SwiftServe framework. The tests were run on a local machine and the results are stored in CSV and XML files.

Test Configurations
-------------------

The JMeter test plan was configured to simulate up to 100 concurrent users, with a ramp-up time of 1 second.

The API server was running on a local machine with 8GB of RAM and an Intel Core i5 processor.

Publishing Results
------------------

To publish the test results, simply commit the changes to this directory to the repository on the desired branch.

Additional Notes
----------------

Keep in mind that these test results were generated on a local machine, and may not be indicative of the performance of the API in a production environment. Further testing in a production-like environment is recommended to ensure optimal performance.
